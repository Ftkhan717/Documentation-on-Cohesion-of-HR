### How to schedule meeting on Ms Team: 

* There are two kinds of interviews: 

* One is gorilla recruitment.

* The second one is discovery interview.

* In the gorilla interview we do an interview immediately, like if I just messaged you that in 5 mins you will be interviewed.

* In the discovery interview, we give the time, the email, manual guide and other things that will be related to the company and interview..

* First, go to calender.

* In the new meeting drop down, click on schedule the meeting.

* Write the title i.e. name of the person and then write (interview).

* Add participants in the meeting.

* Add the due timings.
